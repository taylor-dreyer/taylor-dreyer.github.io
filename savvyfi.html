            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                SavvyFi is an AI-powered personal finance web application developed during a 12-hour hackathon challenge. The application was designed to help users take control of their financial health by providing an all-in-one platform for tracking spending, setting budgets, managing savings goals, and receiving real-time financial advice.

                The platform features an interactive dashboard that gives users a comprehensive view of their financial status at a glance. With smart budget planning tools, users can create customized budgets based on their income and spending patterns. The goal tracking feature allows users to set and monitor progress toward financial objectives, whether saving for a vacation, building an emergency fund, or paying off debt.

                What sets SavvyFi apart is its integrated AI assistant that acts as a personal financial advisor. This intelligent feature analyzes user data to provide personalized recommendations, answer financial questions, and offer guidance on improving financial habits. The team focused on creating a user experience that makes managing money simpler, smarter, faster, and more accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial expertise.

                Built collaboratively with a team of developers, SavvyFi demonstrates the power of rapid prototyping and teamwork in creating meaningful technology solutions that address real-world problems.
