            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Lucid Reader is a web-based accessibility tool built with React that empowers users with ADHD, dyslexia, and visual impairments to engage more effectively with digital text. The application addresses the challenge of reading comprehension and focus by providing customizable formatting options that enhance readability and reduce cognitive load.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users can easily paste text directly into the application or upload documents for processing. Once the content is loaded, they gain access to a suite of readability-enhancing features designed to meet diverse accessibility needs. The application offers a selection of specially designed fonts including OpenDyslexic (created specifically for dyslexic readers), Mali (with clear letter differentiation), and Atkinson Hyperlegible (optimized for low vision readers).
            </p>
            <p>
                A standout feature of Lucid Reader is its bionic reading implementation. This innovative approach strategically highlights the initial portions of words, guiding the eye and helping the brain complete the word recognition process more efficiently. Research suggests this technique can significantly improve reading speed and comprehension, particularly for individuals who struggle with traditional text formatting.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project was developed with a deep commitment to inclusive design, ensuring that technology serves as an equalizer rather than a barrier. By combining multiple evidence-based accessibility strategies in a single, user-friendly platform, Lucid Reader demonstrates how thoughtful software design can make a meaningful difference in people's daily lives.
